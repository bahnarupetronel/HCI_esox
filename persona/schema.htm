                       Bogdan Kissinger is a graphic designer who has limited interest in programming and esoteric languages. His primary focus is on visual design and creativity rather than technical coding. He finds esoteric programming languages confusing and impractical due to their complex syntax and unconventional approach.

                        Bogdan prefers tools and environments that are visually-oriented and intuitive, enabling him to express his creativity effectively. He has little motivation to invest time in learning and using esoteric programming languages, as he sees them as a distraction from his main area of expertise.

                        Bogdan's frustrations mainly stem from the lack of intuitive user interfaces and documentation in esoteric languages. He struggles to understand the purpose and practical applications of these languages and would rather focus on enhancing his skills in graphic design and visual arts.

                        Mihai Lupu is a seasoned software engineer with a passion for exploring new programming languages and techniques. He has extensive experience in various programming languages and enjoys pushing the boundaries of traditional coding paradigms.

                        Mihai actively seeks opportunities to expand his skills and knowledge by delving into esoteric programming languages. He is intrigued by their unconventional syntax and unique approaches to problem-solving. He finds joy in the intellectual challenge and creative thinking required to understand and utilize esoteric languages effectively.

                        One of Mihai's goals is to identify practical use cases where esoteric languages can offer unique solutions or advantages over mainstream languages. He is interested in finding ways to incorporate these languages into real-world projects to explore their potential benefits.

                        However, Mihai faces frustrations due to the limited availability of comprehensive learning resources for esoteric languages. He often struggles to find reliable and well-documented interpreters and development environments tailored to these languages. Additionally, the scarcity of real-world projects utilizing esoteric languages makes it challenging for him to apply his skills in practical scenarios.
